## plan

### complete the project
some function hasn't been implemented, like view Logs, viplist. Current goal is to complete all the coding

### better role control

 Currently, line-up only has basic functions such as add a user, remove a user, or freeze the queue. In the future, we may add more specific functions such as blacklist and more options to handle different situations. 

### specs for machine-readable logging

Currently, the logging function is really simple, it only logs what has happened. In the future, we may implement machine-readable logging for further analysis. But this plan is only a draft with low implementation priority.

### accessibility evaluation

Currently, the test cases only cover the use cases, but in the future, we will do more end to end test. we will focus on different OS capabilities, different browsers capability and evaluation, and the accessibility evaluation.
