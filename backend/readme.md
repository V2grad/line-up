## Setup

### Setup Virtual Environment

We strongly recommend using `venv` during development to avoid possible dependency pollution

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

#### Activate venv

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

If you saw `(venv)` at the front of your current commandline, then you have successfully enter virtual environment

#### Exit venv

```bash
deactivate
```

### Install Dependency

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Initialize

```bash
./scripts/init.sh
```

### Run

```bash
./scripts/run.sh
```
